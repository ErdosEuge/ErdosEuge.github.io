    "Name":"Insurance-based Recommender System",
    "Description":"Designed a recommender system to suggest the most suitable insurance policy to clients of a major Italian insurance company, leveraging both historical product ownership and metadata on customer and product features. The evaluation process began with a simple frequency-based baseline, recommending the most common policy across the dataset. From there, increasingly sophisticated techniques were introduced, including content-based filtering based on customer and product attributes, collaborative filtering through user- and item-based k-NN, and matrix factorization approaches like SVD. More advanced models such as gradient boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) and neural collaborative filtering were also explored to capture complex interactions. The performance of each model was evaluated using standard recommendation metrics such as Precision@k, Recall@k, and MAP.",

    "Description":"Developed an end-to-end NLP system to extract, process, and operationalize information from customer claims related to banking products. The approach leveraged Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques to identify and classify the underlying root causes of each complaint. On top of the extracted entities, an anomaly detection layer was implemented to proactively identify unusual patterns and potential operational risks. Finally, results were made accessible through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, allowing stakeholders to explore trends, entity distributions, and flagged anomalies in real time.",
